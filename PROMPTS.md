# AI Prompts Used

## Project planning
- "Add a Cloudflare Workers AI chat app with Durable Object memory, include a simple web UI, and document how to run it locally and deploy it."
- "Connect the Workers AI assistant to the SocialNetwork project context and align UI copy with SocialNetwork features."

## Implementation details
- "Create a Workers AI handler using Llama 3.3, store conversation history in a Durable Object, and expose /api/chat and /api/reset endpoints for the UI."
- "Draft a README section with setup steps using Wrangler and explain required bindings (AI + Durable Objects + assets)."
